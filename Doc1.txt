Company Refund & Return Policy

Our company allows customers to return products within 30 days of purchase. To be eligible for a return, the product must be unused, in its original packaging, and accompanied by the original receipt.

Refunds are processed within 7–10 business days after the returned product is received and inspected. The refund will be credited back to the original payment method.

Digital products, downloadable software, and perishable goods are non-refundable.

If a customer receives a damaged product, they must report it within 48 hours of delivery. The company will arrange a replacement or full refund after verification.

For any disputes related to refunds, customers can contact the support team via email or phone during business hours.
